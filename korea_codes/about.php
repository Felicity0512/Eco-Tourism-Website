               <h3>A relaxing hike for anyone.</h3>
               <p>Hiking Mt. Tagapo is automatically interesting and different because of the boat ride one needs to take to reach it. Located on Talim Island in the middle of Laguna de Bay, the first part of the trip makes the hike more exciting. The trail is generally straightforward and should not pose a problem for anyone who is reasonably fit and healthy. The summit view is also good, with a 360-degree view from up top! Also, ask the local guides to share a bit of history as to why there's a huge hole dug at the summit.</p>

               <h3>Centuries old church for your Visita Iglesia or sidetrip from Mt. Tagapo</h3>
               <p>From what I've read, church was built from 1792 to 1800 and undergone major renovation in 1853. The church belfry seemed restored just recently. It lacks ceiling, thus exposing the wooden trusses that supports the roof, giving the church a rustic ambiance. You may include the church in itinerary when performing Visita Iglesia in Rizal province, or a side trip when hiking Mt. Tagapo.</p>

               <h3>Great Historical Rock Art</h3>
               <p>The Angono-Binangonan Petroglyphs was an interesting site to visit. Having background in arts and design, I appreciated its historical and cultural significance. However, the road leading to the main entrance needs improvement. Utmost importance to have well maintained restrooms. Lastly, I think, more infographics on the boardwalk area for the tourists to have better appreciation.</p>
